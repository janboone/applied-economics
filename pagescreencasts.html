<h2 id="org2792d47">How are the screencasts supposed to help?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2792d47">
<p>
For the python part of the course we use <a href="https://github.com/janboone/applied-economics">this notebook</a>. The notebook is fairly self-explanatory, but you may get stuck with some of the questions. The screencasts are meant to help you along if you do not know how to proceed.
</p>

<p>
For students without a programming background (like most economics students) it can be intimidating or frustrating to start typing code. Reasons include not knowing how to do it perfectly or getting scared when there is an error message. Obviously, this is not necessary nor helpful when trying to learn a programming language. But the upshot is that some students do not try anything, sit back and type the correct answers when given to them. Needless to say, you do not learn how to program in python by typing in the correct answers given in class.
</p>

<p>
The way we solve this in class is to give plenty of time to solve the questions yourself. In economics terminology: by keeping you in class, we reduce your opportunity costs to zero. Hence, you might as well type in some code and press Shift-Enter.
</p>

<p>
We cannot do this with a screencast. Chances are, you understand how fast-forward works on the video. Hence, the screencasts give you hints on how to finish the notebook but it does not give you step-by-step answers for each question. If you still get stuck, ask us during the tutorials.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge8630d6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge8630d6">Why are there screencasts?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge8630d6">
<p>
The screencasts were initially developed because of the 2020 corona crisis where students were no longer able to come to the campus of Tilburg University. But they can also be used as complements to the lecturers and classes taught.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org10500de" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org10500de">Suggested use of the screencasts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org10500de">
<p>
Just watching the screencasts is not going to be very useful for you. The best way to use them is as follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>first read the relevant section in the notebook and try to solve the questions by yourself</li>
<li>if you manage to do so, you are done and there is no need to watch the screencast; if you do not manage to answer all the questions, you have the background for the screencast (which is rather short and does not motivate the underlying economic problem) and you know what problems to look for in the video</li>
<li>type along with what we do in the screencast. Pause the video if you need more time to type</li>
<li>experiment with the code that we give you in the video either during the video or after watching it; try different numerical values, use different syntax or a different library; if you get an error, google it to see what is going on etc.</li>
<li>in general, play around with the python code; that is the best way to understand and learn the language</li>
</ul>

<p>
With screencasts there is &#x2013;obviously&#x2013; no interaction between teachers and students. This is a problem when you run into an error message. In class students then immediately raise their hand to understand what is happening.
</p>

<p>
As this is not possible with a screencast, here are some tips on how to deal with error messages. Also note that as the screencast is typed &ldquo;live&rdquo;, so there will be error messages in the videos as well and you can see how we deal with these as we go along.
</p>

<p>
Python error messages:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>start reading the error message at the end; hence scroll down in your notebook to see the last line of the error message. This will usually give a clue of what is happening</li>
<li>if you do not know what the last line means, use copy/paste to google it or go to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> directly</li>
<li>reading &ldquo;upwards&rdquo; from the last line, you can trace how the error was generated</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="org65ffd83">Prerequisite knowledge</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org65ffd83">
<p>
<b>Economics</b>: this introduction to python is part of an MSc degree in Economics. Hence, we assume that you know what utility is and how utility (and producer surplus, if relevant)
adds up to welfare. You know how demand and supply curves are derived. What market power is, how a Cournot model is solved. Concepts like asymmetric information, adverse selection and moral hazard ring a bell. You know what risk is and how it can be measured. You know what the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> is, as later on we will use their data. You have done introductions to statistics and econometrics. Generally speaking, you understand the economics parts of the notebooks, though not necessarily their python implementation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Python</b>: before you start with the notebook and the screencasts you need some basic knowledge of python. You can use <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">Datacamp</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er-">Socratica</a>, or introduction videos to python, numpy etc. from one of the big python conferences, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GcDQblpQ_M1V3PQPoLWiDAC">SciPy 2019</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPbTDk1hBo3xof51R8pk3kP1BVBuMYP9c">PyCon 2019</a>.
</p>

<p>
Things you should be familiar with is the syntax of python (e.g. the role of spaces), how to import libraries (difference between <code>import numpy as np, import numpy, from numpy import *</code>), how to define a function, use of datatypes like lists, tuples, dictionaries, <code>numpy</code> arrays (what is the difference between adding lists (using &ldquo;+&rdquo;) and adding numpy arrays), you understand slicing notation for arrays and lists, the use of masks to select data from an array, you are able to plot a function or data points with <code>matplotlib</code>, you can read data into a dataframe with <code>pandas</code> and then manipulate this data (define new columns/variables).

<p>
You can use JupyterLab on the Tilburg University server. But you can also install it locally on your computer using the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda distribution</a>. The basics of the following introduction are the same in both cases (and for google colab).
</p>

<p>
The video was recorded using an older version of the website; but it will look similar in your year.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this video is to give you an introduction to JupyterLab; not an introduction to python. So, do not worry if you do not understand the python code that is typed and evaluated.

</p>

<p>
Topics we cover in this video:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>using <code>git</code> to &ldquo;clone&rdquo; the <code>applied-economics</code> repository on JupyterLab;</li>
<li>difference between a code cell and a markdown cell in a jupyter notebook;</li>
<li>you can use the menu at the top to switch between Markdown and Code;</li>
<li>you evaluate both a code cell and a markdown cell by pressing the SHIFT and ENTER keys at the same time;</li>
<li>if you want to edit an evaluated markdown cell, go to the cell and press ENTER; or double click on the cell with your mouse;</li>
<li>how to create headings (using <code>#</code>) and bullet lists (using <code>*</code>) in markdown;</li>
<li>create a link in markdown;</li>
<li>how to type math in markdown using <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">latex</a> and the delimiters <code>$ $</code></li>
<li>in a code cell, you can type python code:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>this can be useful if you want to make notes on your datacamp courses</li>
<li>type and evaluate the python code (from datacamp) and explain what the code does in a markdown cell;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>if you have long variable or function names, use the TAB key to complete the names;</li>
<li>this also works if you want to type functions associated with a library like <code>numpy</code>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g.type <code>np.ara</code> and then TAB to see the completions;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>apply the numpy <code>sum</code> function to an array <code>my_list</code>: <code>np.sum(my_list</code>) or <code>my_list.sum()</code></li>
<li>create a plot using <code>matplotlib.pyplot</code> and add labels to the axes, a title to the figure and a legend.</li>
<li>when you are finished with a notebook, you can close the file and do not forget to close the kernel as well (see the video on how to do this)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if you have too many kernel sessions running, you can run out of memory on the server meaning you cannot evaluate python code anymore.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Questions you can try before continuing:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>in a markdown cell, we can create \(\alpha\) by typing latex <code>$\alpha$</code>; now in a code cell type <code>\alpha</code> and then the TAB key; this gives you the <i>variable</i> \(\alpha\);</li>
<li>typing in a code cell \(\alpha = 5\) gives this variable \(\alpha\) the value 5;</li>
<li>plot the function \(f(x)=x^3\) on the interval \([-1,1]\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you want to know more about the use of JupyterLab, there are a number of introductions to JupyterLab on the web. Here is one (start video at 9 minutes): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=152&amp;v=Gzun8PpyBCo&amp;feature=emb_logo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=152&amp;v=Gzun8PpyBCo&amp;feature=emb_logo</a>
</p>

<p>
You can also google &ldquo;jupyterlab introduction&rdquo; and the <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">documentation</a> can be useful as well.

<h3 id="orgade5d3b">getting the repository in colab</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgade5d3b">
<p>
If for some reason you would like to use the notebook on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true">google colab</a> (e.g. because the university server is temporarily down), the following video shows how to import the applied economics repository into colab.
</p>

<p>
<iframe width="660" height="503" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LVt0yagCwD8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<p>
Topics we cover in the video:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>go to google colab; then from the menu: File =&gt; Upload notebook</li>
<li>in pop-up window click on the GitHub tab and copy/paste the web address of the github repository that you would like to upload; in our case <code>https://github.com/janboone/applied-economics</code></li>
<li>if you want to install a new library in colab, e.g. wbdata, type <code>!pip install wbdata</code></li>
<li>install all libraries such that you can run the cell with import statements without errors</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="org364e039">Why am I using emacs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org364e039">
<p>
As explained <a href="#org2792d47">above</a>, one of the worries is that students sit back and copy/paste whatever is done in the videos. To force them to make more of an effort, I do not use jupyter notebooks in the screencasts. Hence, a bit more &ldquo;mental processing&rdquo; is needed to follow along. This is also the reason that we do not publish the notebooks from the videos. Students need to type along with the video; not copy/paste from the final file.
</p>

<p>
Further, Emacs makes it easier to give a presentation in the screencast than jupyter notebooks, e.g. by folding sections that are finished and by giving completion on latex snippets.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="org5cc6787">Jupyter vs Emacs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5cc6787">
<p>
When you see my use Emacs in the videos, you can spot some differences with JupyterLab:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>evaluating a code cell with python in jupyter is done by pressing Shift-Enter (that is, press the Shift and Enter keys at the same time); in Emacs press C-c C-c (that is press Control and C simultaneously two times)</li>
<li>to get help on a function, type e.g. <code>np.arange?</code> in a code cell and evaluate the cell</li>
<li>to type text in a jupyter notebook, turn a code-cell into a Markdown cell; in Emacs you can simply type text</li>
<li>to create a new code cell in jupyter: press &ldquo;a&rdquo; (new cell above) or &ldquo;b&rdquo; (new cell below) when you do not have a cursor in the current cell (if you do have a cursor, first press the ESC key); in Emacs (and org-mode version &gt;= 9.2) type C-c C-, and a menu will appear of block types (python, ipython, elisp etc.)</li>
<li>use the TAB key to complete function, variable etc. names. Works both in jupyter and Emacs</li>
<li>to get greek letters in a code block of a jupyter notebook, use the latex expression for the greek letter (without the delimiters <code>$ $</code>) and type TAB; e.g.type <code>\alpha</code> and then press TAB</li>
<li>add <code>%matplotlib inline</code> after importing <code>matplotlib.pyplot</code> to get the figures in the notebook/file itself</li>

Topics we cover in this video:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>optimal way to allocate a fixed number of products among a set of consumers</li>
<li>use of <code>np.arange</code> to generate a vector of numbers</li>
<li><code>np.random.normal</code> and <code>tf.random.normal</code> to generate a vector of random numbers</li>
<li>sort a vector of numbers</li>
<li>use slicing to select a subset of entries in a vector \(x\), e.g. <code>x[:5]</code></li>
<li>use <code>format</code> to format the output in a print statement</li>
<li>sum entries in a vector</li>
</ul>

<p>
Questions you should be able to answer before continuing:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>what is the welfare maximizing way to allocate \(m\) products among \(n>m\) consumers?</li>
<li>how can you calculate the Lagrange multiplier in the optimization problem at the end of the video using python?</li>

<li>plot the demand function with <code>plt.plot</code>; use <code>plt.vlines</code> to plot a vertical line</li>

</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>show &#x2013;using python&#x2013; that welfare in the market (<code>welfare_2</code>) is below the max. possible welfare</li>
<li>the assignment in the notebook: run the model with the income distribution two times and show that higher income inequality can lead to lower welfare in the market. That is, there is an efficiency argument for income redistribution in a market context.</li>

You should be able to do the market power section on your own. It shows a graph suggesting the monopoly price is lower than the perfect competition price. In this context this is simply wrong. The question is: what is wrong in the python code?
</p>

<p>
Hence, test parts of the code to understand where things are going wrong. To solve this problem, you may want to look at the function <code>min</code>. That is, evaluate <code>min?</code> and e.g. <code>min(3,8)</code>.

Topics we cover in the video:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>create a 2 dimensional vector with draws from a normal distribution; note that in the notebook you only need a 1 dimensional draw (for the merged firm&rsquo;s cost level)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the rows are states of the world, the first column is firm 1&rsquo;s cost level, the second column firm 2&rsquo;s costs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>create a Pandas dataframe with <code>pd.DataFrame</code> and a dictionary of the form: <code>{'column name': vector with values}</code></li>
<li>define new columns in the dataframe</li>
<li>two ways you can refer to a column in a dataframe: e.g. <code>df.Q</code> and <code>df['Q']</code>; note that you cannot use the former if there are spaces in the column name</li>
</ul>

<p>
Questions you should be able to answer:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>instead of defining <code>q1,q2</code> separately, define the vector <code>q</code> as follows and use this vector to create the dataframe <code>df</code> (hint: use <code>q.shape</code>)</li>
</ul>
<pre class="example">
costs = tf.random.normal([50,2],0.2,0.05).numpy()
q = np.array([sp.optimize.fsolve(lambda x: fixed_point(x,costs[i]),[0,0]) for i in range(50)])

</p>

<p>
In our previous Cournot model (and in the notebook), we defined the function <code>reaction</code> in such a way that it is specific to the number of firms in the market. This video introduces a function reaction that is more general. It makes the code more readable but also a bit more complicated.
