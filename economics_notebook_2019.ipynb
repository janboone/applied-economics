One way to do this is to reward good outcomes. That is, the higher the return is, the higher their income will be. That is, employees get a bonus for good *outcomes*. Not for investments with a high expected outcome because that is hard to monitor.\n",

Also in 2011 we can take the difference in means for 17 and 19 year olds.
