Schedule for the course
=======================

questions
---------

If you have questions/comments about this course, go to the `issues
page <https://github.com/janboone/open_source_for_economists/issues>`_
open a new issue (with the green "New issue" button) and type your
question. Use a title that is informative (e.g. not "question", but
"question about assignment 2"). Go to the next box ("Leave a comment")
and type your question. Then click on "Submit new issue". We will
answer your question as quickly as possible.

The advantages of the issue page include:

* if you have a question, other students may have it as well; in this
  way we answer the questions in a way that everyone can see it. Also
  before asking the question, you may want to check whether it was
  asked/answered before on the issue page
* we answer your question more quickly than when you email us
* you increase your knowledge of github!

Only when you need to include privately sensitive information ("my cat
has passed away"), you can send an email.

In order to post issues, you need to create a github account (which
you need anyway to follow this course).

Note that if your question is related to another issue, you can react
to the earlier issue and leave a comment in that "conversation".

grade
-----

Your grade is the average of the 3 assignments. Assignments 1 and 2 you do on your own. Assignment 3 in a group.

The assignments are due at 16:00 of the Thursday in the weeks indicated above.

In order for us to grade the assignments, we need to know your github address. After you make a github account, fill in the webform (address can be found on BB). Note that github records when "commits were pushed" (you will learn later on what this means) and hence we can check whether you handed in the assignment in time.
